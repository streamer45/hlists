# Lists of names I use to call hosts


Names are grouped into categories, one file per category, one name per line.

Unless they are super cool I avoid listing names longer than 8 characters.

Feel free to add more :)

Also check out [this](http://seriss.com/people/erco/unixtools/hostnames.html) great resource which gave some inspiration.
